Feature: addValue command test
    As a developer
    I want to demonstrate addValue command

    Background:
        Given I open the url "http://www.tlkeith.com/WebDriverIOTutorialTest.html"

    Scenario:
        When I set "Syed" to the inputfield "#fname"
        Then I expect that inputfield "#fname" contains the text "Syed"
        When I add " Farhan" to the inputfield "#fname"
        Then I expect that inputfield "#fname" contains the text "Syed Farhan"
